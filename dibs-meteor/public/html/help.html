			A single click to the map will open a window where you can enter the information to post a new item! Be careful with the information that you provide as once it is on dibs it will stay there.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="subheader">What are you seeing?</div>
	<hr>
	<div class="content">
		<p>
			In the middle of the page you are seeing Dibs posts! Click on a post to see details! What are the colors you may ask? The colors denote the age of the post. Bright green colors are the newest posts. The green fades to yellow and then red as the post ages. Posts that are bright red are more than three days old.
		</p>
		<p>
			On the right hand side of the page there is a post wall that shows live updates of new items available on Dibs. Our live updates have two sources: 1) the ReUse mailing list (from which updates are pulled every 30 seconds) and 2) items that users have posted directly on Dibs.
		</p>
		<p>
			On the left hand side of the page we have a quick-nav bar that allows the user to access relevent account information. Under the user settings tab (denoted with a gear and the user's name), there is an account logout option. Other features such as changing passwords and adding user-item preferences are coming soon! Also in the quick-nav bar we have a preview window for the user to track the number of points that they have. Users can gain points by posting items on Dibs, inquiring about items on Dibs, etc. Other quick-nav features (such as item keyword filtering) are coming soon!

	<div class="subheader">General Rules</div>
	<hr>
	<div class="content">
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					The reuse lists are unmoderated email lists. You may email a list without being on it. You may receive bounce messages for invalid email addresses on the lists. Don't re-email your message unless you're sure you mispelled the list name.
				</li>
				<li>
					No attachments--put pictures on a website or send them to individuals when requested. The large files cause some people problems.
				</li>
				<li>
					Keep all posts relevant to the particular list. Discussion and flaming must be moved to reuse-discuss. The reuse administrators will personally email people who misuse the lists.
				</li>
				<li>
					The reuse lists are for the benefit of the MIT community including students, staff, and alumni. You are encouraged to tell your MIT friends and MIT co-workers about reuse, but please tell them to email reuse-owner with all questions, not the list itself.
				</li>
				<li>
					For all of these lists, items must be legally transferrable and located in or delivered to the greater Boston area.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

	<div class="subheader">Dibs Rules</div>
	<hr>
	<p>Dibs is only for giving away free items.</p>
	<div class="content">
		<div class="contentSubtitle">Offering Items for Dibs</div>
		<p>
		Please include the following information about items:
			<ul>
				<li>
					What it is
				</li>
				<li>
					Who to talk to (or not to talk to) about picking it up (name, email, phone, etc.)
				</li>
				<li>
					Where it can be picked up
				</li>
				<li>
					Approximate size/weight (will it require two people to carry, etc.)
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>You may offer items as "first come, first served" or choose who will receive an item. If you expect money or other goods for your item, it must be posted to reuse-sell. If you will choose the person who gets the item, then email reuse when the item has been claimed or when you have enough claimants (if someone changes their mind after they see it, you can email reuse again).</p>
		<p>Items with MIT Property Tags that do not have deactivation stickers should not be posted to reuse or removed from campus until they do. To deactivate an item, please contact Ken McLaughlin (kenmc at mit.edu, 617-258-8475). </p>
		<p>If you leave items outside of your office or dorm room, you are responsible for keeping them orderly and cleaning up whatever does not get taken within a couple of days (it's best to leave a note saying the pile is for reuse and the date it'll be disposed of).</p>
		<p>Under no circumstances may monitors be left for MIT to clean up. If the monitor belongs to MIT, you must arrange with the Properties office to have it recycled. If it doesn't belong to MIT, it must be disposed of through your house manager or put out with your personal recycling at home. Many cities, especially Cambridge, will recycle monitors for free (generally one per week), but MIT must pay to recycle them.</p>
		<div class="contentSubtitle">Picking up items from reuse </div>
		<p>If an item is available as "first come, first served, don't contact me" and you pick it up, then promptly mail the list to let people know it's gone. You can send email saying you're about to go get an item (to save others the trip), but you cannot reserve an item this way.</p>
		<p>A reuse posting cannot be considered permission to enter a space that is usually unaccessible to you. If the offerer will not escort you, consider the item off-limits.</p>
		<p>If you see an item with a deactivation sticker on it, this doesn't imply that the item is up for reuse! Please don't take (or post) anything unless you are certain that its owner is trying to get rid of it.</p>
		<p>This service is not linked with the MIT Campus Police or the Properties office. If you are not MIT affiliated, you may be trespassing on MIT's campus, and the Campus Police will not look kindly upon you removing property from MIT.</p>
