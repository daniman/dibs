			In the middle of the page you are seeing Dibs posts! Click on a post to see details! What are the colors you may ask? The colors denote the age of the post. Bright green colors are the newest posts. The green fades to yellow and then red as the post ages. Posts that are bright red are more than three days old.

		<p>
			On the right hand side of the page there is a post wall that shows live updates of new items available on Dibs. Our live updates have two sources: 1) the ReUse mailing list (from which updates are pulled every 30 seconds) and 2) items that users have posted directly on Dibs.

			On the left hand side of the page we have a quick-nav bar that allows the user to access relevent account information. Under the user settings tab (denoted with a gear and the user's name), there is an account logout option. Other features such as changing passwords and adding user-item preferences are coming soon! Also in the quick-nav bar we have a preview window for the user to track the number of points that they have. Users can gain points by posting items on Dibs, inquiring about items on Dibs, etc. Other quick-nav features (such as item keyword filtering) are coming soon!

			A single click to the map will open a window where you can enter the information to post a new item! Be careful with the information that you provide as once it is on dibs it will stay there.
