		<p>
			Reuse@mit.edu is an email list that nearly all MIT students subscribe to or at least hear about when they first arrive on campus. The MIT Reuse lists contribute to MIT&#39;s green initiative and have the additional benefit of helping students explore campus and meet new people.
		</p>
		<p>
			Unfortunately, many students choose to unsubscribe from reuse or hesitate to sign up due to the large volume of emails sent to the reuse list every day.
		</p>
		<p>
			The current solution to this problem is to use email filters to place reuse listings in a separate folder. However, doing this still decreases the amount of active reusers which leaves some items unclaimed.
		</p>
		<p>
			With Dibs, we are looking to create one tool to help the reuse community manage all aspects of reuse, not just sorting through users emails. Dibs is at its core a reuse enhancement suite.
		</p>
		<p>
			Dibs lies on top of the preexisting reuse framework that allows users to visualize reuse listings on a map interface. The map interface can help users determine their proximity to reuse listings.
		</p>

	<div class="content">
		<p>
			In its fully featured state, Dibs will include rigorous backend email parsing to allow continued use of the current reuse email system with the added benefit of having a map interface. Dibs will also feature keyword alerts (allow users to receive parsed, condensed email or text alerts only about listings of interest to the user) and a rewards system (encouraging users to participate in reuse through Dibs).

		<p>
			There are three types of Dibs users: The Poster, The Swiper, and The Secret Poster. These types are not mutually exclusive (one user could exhibit any one, two, or three user types).
		</p>

		<div class="contentSubtitle">The Poster</div>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					The Poster is a user that signs up with Dibs that creates a reuse posting on the Dibs website.
				</li>
				<li>
					The poster begins with an item they wish to list on reuse.
				</li>
				<li>
					The poster visits the Dibs website and creates an account on the welcome screen.
				</li>
				<li>
					The poster can then create a reuse listing directly from the Dibs website by clicking on the &#34;Create a Listing&#34; button.
				</li>
				<li>
					The poster fills out the form fields indicating the item, type and location of the reuse listing along with other additional comments.
				</li>
				<li>
					This post is saved to the Dibs DB and will be available for view by others in the area.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<div class="contentSubtitle">The Swiper</div>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					The Swiper is a user that signs up with Dibs for the sole purpose of locating reuse listings.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<div class="contentSubtitle">The Secret Poster</div>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					The Secret Poster is a user that does not sign up with the Dibs who sends an email to the reuse@mit.edu mailing list. A Dibs posting is automatically generated and displayed to all registered Dibs users.
				</li>
			</ul>
